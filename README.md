ASSASSINS IS A WEB APP THAT ALLOWS YOU TO PLAY WITH LESS FUSS AND HEADACHE.
IT MAKES ORGANIZING A GAME EASIER AND MORE STREAMLINE.

# Rules
Assassins is a game where everyone in the game is assigned a target, who is someone else in the game. You then find your target in real life and eliminate him. After eliminating your target, you go after his target.

# Why
When I saw this game organized by others, they would put names in a hat to assign people their targets, then they would email each person. On top of that, reporting a kill would require the person to post a picture on Facebook. This made things very cumbersome. I thought that if I could automate this, it could be less of a headache, more fun for everyone, and entertaining to see people fall off as the game goes on. With that, I started building Assassins.

I built Assassins as a way to teach myself ASP.NET MVC5. 
Here are some of the things I learned through this project:
- Basic web design, using HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Google Material design concepts and principles (https://material.io/guidelines/)
- Entity Framework / Code First Migrations
- C#, LINQ, partial views, JavaScript bundles

# To-do
- Fix looping targets (I can explain this in person) (http://johnheng.net/hengouts/assassins/)
- Introduce a modern JavaScript framework (React.JS, Angular.JS)
- Allow Facebook / Google authorization
- Allow multiple concurrent games as well as open play (outside of student organization)

# Plugins
- jquery.timeago.js
